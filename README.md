# MyPower
A python script which helps determine the best power offers available through [powertochoose.org](powertochoose.org), a Public Utility Commission of Texas website. While [powertochoose.org](powertochoose.org) has lots of valid/useful information for consumers to sort though, the search format leads to many companies offering "teaser" type rates which make it more difficult for consumers to understand what their utility bills will truely be.

This script attempts to clean up results by outputting the top offers based on the consumer's average Kwh consumption. Additional questions will be added to allow to sort by renewable energy plans and length of term.
